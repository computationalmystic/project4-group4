# To Do list:

## Common themes:

### Classes - brainstorm what the base class needs then what the subclasses need

### Functions - functions like login/logout, submit assignment, grade assignment, and comments on assignment were common themes for each of our lists

### Testing - making sure that everything works the way it is supposed to


### Next steps (On deck):
- We each can make one subclass
- One person needs to make the superclass
- One person needs to start on the login function
  
### Nothing in progress.
  
### Nothing is done yet.

All of our to do lists were relatively similar, and were just breaking down functionality into what it would translate into code. It would make sense from here to assign one person to create the 3 different classes for student, professor and TA. Another person would use these classes and build functions. And the third person can investigate the system requirements and build an environment for us to work in and host our application, as well as design an ER diagram for the system to be intemplemented.
