To view the webpage:
-
-Use the software "Brackets" to locally show the webpage.

-Click on the lighting bolt on the index.html page (it will be on the right). Make sure all the files are structured correctly. 
-When clicking on a repo, give it a second to make the API call. 

Description of rationale for technical approach:
-
-We decided to use JavaScript and jQuery to make our API calls as that would make it simplier. Our UI was chosen to make the webpage look pretty. 

Assesment of team memeber skills:
-
-It was good that our group members had experience with web development and JavaScript, as this assignment would be impossible to complete without.
